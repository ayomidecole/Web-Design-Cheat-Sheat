# Web-Design-Cheatsheet
My web design cheat sheet, feel free to use this code as the basis to creating your own cheat sheet. I One thing I think it really cool about this cheat sheet is the box-shadow when you hover above the table. Preyy neat stuff, I hope you find it as cool as I do. 

Feel free to fork this repo and add your own styles. Maybe even create a HTML section. I will also document changes in this README.
